Family Table is an open product that's being built by a fantastic group of people on [Assembly](https://assemblymade.com/family-table). Anybody can join in building this product and earn a stake of the profit.

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
